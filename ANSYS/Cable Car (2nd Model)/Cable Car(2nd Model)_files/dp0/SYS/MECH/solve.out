 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 199 and contact element type 198 has been set up.  The

 During this loadstep the PCG iterative solver took more than 1000       
 iterations to solve the system of equations.  In the future it may be   
 more efficient to choose a direct solver, such as the SPARSE solver,    
 for this analysis.
